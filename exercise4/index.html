			This summary is taken from chapter 5 of ABSC 100.
			<br><br>
			Operant behavior is behavior influenced by antecedents and consequences. In this
			chapter, we focused on consequences and discussed how contingent consequences can
			influence behavior. Contingent consequences are caused by the operant response; that is, there
			is an IF response à THEN consequence relation between them. As you will see in later chapters,
			there isn’t always a one-response one-consequence relation. Sometimes, the contingency
			requires that many responses occur before the consequence occurs (for example, all of the
			studying that goes into earning a good grade on an exam).
			<br><br>
			An important type of consequence is called a reinforcer. Reinforcers increase behavior
			relative to a no-reinforcer baseline. When we turn on and off the consequence, and behavior
			increases and decreases, respectively, that consequence functions as a reinforcer – it maintains
			behavior. Much of our everyday behavior is maintained by reinforcers. See how many you can
			identify in your own life.
			<br><br>
			Understanding the reinforcers that influence your behavior can help you live a better life.
			Are there some reinforcers that lead to adaptive behavior? Can you arrange more of those? What
			about reinforcers that maintain maladaptive behavior? Can you minimize those? Are you
			repeating the same behaviors and getting lackluster results? Should you introduce some 
			variability into your life? One of the joys of studying principles of behavior analysis is using them
			to improve your own life, and the lives of those around you. So, don’t just learn the principles
			covered in this book, use them!
